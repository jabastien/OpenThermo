# openThermo

*Open-source thermostat for control of simple on/off furnaces.*

## About

This project was born after renting an old house with a crappy furnace controller. The crappy controller in the house used a timer to control when the heat was on; there was no closed-loop feedback to regulate temperature.

This project solves the issue by adding closed-loop temperature feedback.
